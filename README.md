# BigData_DNASequencing
I'm working on enhancing the efficiency of DNA sequencing in the subject 'Big Data for Biological Applications'. This project uses De Bruijn graph as a data structure for the efficient representation of genome sequencing. In order to reduce the space complexity, I'm working on dynamic addition and removal of edges from the De Bruijn graph. It is based on two algorithmic pillars. One is the use of Hashing Algorithms, that is, a combination of Rabin Karp and Minimal Perfect Hashing is used to represent the k-mers. Another major concept is the graph representation into a forest cover to store edge information using IN, OUT matrices. This project uses the E.coli datasets for experimentation purpose.
